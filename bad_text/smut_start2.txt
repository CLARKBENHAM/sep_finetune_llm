He stilled her hands to push her back on the desk, and before she could wrap her head around what he was intending to do, he rucked her skirt up and ripped her knickers cleanly off her body. Hermione gasped, but before she could sit up, he was kneeling in front of her and sliding her skirt up her waist, kissing and sucking bruises up her thighs.  

His mouth was driving her to madness, teasing and biting, his hot tongue dipping inside her entrance as she moaned her approval. She bucked off the table with a keen when his tongue finally licked up to her clit, circling, flicking— but she shook her head when he glanced up at her, his hands still palming her breasts.  

“Later. Inside— I want you inside—” 

“Yes. Fuck—" 

He crawled up her body, his hands wrangling hers against the tabletop, kissing her senseless. And then he pushed into her— the tip of him blunt enough that she gasped, the length long enough that she whimpered at the stretch.

Malfoy groaned lowly, the sound humming deep in Hermione's belly, flooding her with warmth as her lashes fluttered and nipples pulled tight.
