Harry shook his head desperately, his eyes screwed shut. Tom thrust into him again, his movements hard and deep, and Harry cried out, his body convulsing. Tom laughed, his grip on his waist tightening, his other hand keeping his head pinned to the pillow. Harry's sobs echoed through the room, his body convulsing. Tom thrust into him harder, his grip on his hair tightening, and Harry whimpered, his hands clutching at the sheets. He could feel tears running down his cheeks, and he tried desperately to pull away, his legs kicking weakly.

"You're not very strong." Tom laughed. "You can't even struggle properly. You're just a tiny little thing." He thrust in again, and Harry let out a surprised little squeak. His whole body trembled, his legs threatening to give out under him. Tom's grip on his waist was the only thing keeping him upright.

"Hm? What was that? Does that feel good?" Tom purred. He pulled out a little, slamming back in, and Harry's hips jerked, his eyes flying open. Tom leaned down, his mouth right next to Harry's ear. "Hey. Wouldn't it be funny if you came from being raped? That would be so pathetic. Maybe I should try harder, see what happens."

"S-sir-! A-ah-!" Harry sobbed, shaking his head desperately. "No-! No-! Please-!"

Tom thrust into him again, and Harry's hips bucked up. "You know what would be even funnier? If I didn't touch you at all, and you came from having my cock inside you." He thrust into him again, and Harry's back arched, his eyes wide and watery. Tom laughed.

"No-! Please-!" Harry begged, squirming and pushing back. "P-please, s-stop-! I- I'm begging you, s-sir- ah-! It- it hurts, p-please- ah-!"

"No. Not until I'm satisfied."

"A-ah-! Please- please- ah-!"

"Keep begging, pet. It won't work, but I love to hear it."

Harry's voice was raw and hoarse, and the only sound that left his lips was a broken, pitiful whine. Tom's hips snapped forward, and Harry sobbed, shaking his head desperately.
