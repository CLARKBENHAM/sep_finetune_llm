“A-Ning,” Mo Ran’s deep voice was slightly raspier than usual as he walked in through the door at the inn they were staying at. “You’re still up? Aren’t good disciples supposed to be in bed by now?”

Looking up from the book he had been quietly reading, seated in the entrance area of the inn, Chu Wanning felt his cheeks heat up as those familiar, purple eyes of his master settled on him.

“This disciple didn’t want to go to bed before Shizun got back,” he murmured, gaze falling from his teacher’s face to those broad, strong shoulders of his, then back to the book in his lap.

Mo Ran’s lips curled into an amused smile, his eyes sparkling slightly with some sort of emotion.

“What a good disciple this Shizun has.”

Chu Wanning’s blood ran hot and cold at the sudden praise, his fingers tightening around the book in his hands. Neck prickling, he barely managed to hum out a “mn,” before swallowing hard and looking up again, seeking out his Shizun’s face.

“Did… Did Shizun’s mission go well?” Chu Wanning quietly asked, trying to not come across as prying yet unable to hide the slight worry in his voice. He had been worried. He always was when his Shizun went off to fight monsters or other creatures without bringing his disciples with him.

Although Chu Wanning would never question the strength of his teacher, because he knew very well how strong, how capable, how formidable his Shizun was, he still couldn’t quite help the way his stomach sank whenever Mo Ran took off on a mission, or when he left his disciples to go visit a tavern or a brothel. Chu Wanning particularly disliked the last one, his heart clenching up when his Shizun returned to their sect with the smell of someone else on his robes.

He'd always treat his Shizun coldly after one of those trips of his, barely looking towards the older man, Chu Wanning’s phoenix eyes like ice and his shoulders stiff. Mo Ran noticed it every time, of course, and after a significant amount of teasing, cheek-pokes, and secret gifting of sweets, he always managed to warm Chu Wanning up again.

This time was different, though, because Chu Wanning’s Shizun had not been visiting one of those… wretched places. Instead, he had been sent to fight some sort of spirit on the outer edge of this small, mostly forsaken village. He’d brought his disciples with him, but after asking around about the spirit, Mo Ran had made the three of them stay back at the inn without properly explaining why, just saying something about the spirit being ‘too vicious for them to handle’.

Mo Ran sauntered closer to Chu Wanning, then suddenly stopped, his jaw clenching.

“The mission was successful,” he said, lilac eyes moving away from Chu Wanning to stare at the wall instead. For whatever reason, they seemed to be darkening slightly. “The spirit has been destroyed. It did, however, manage to… Ah, your Shizun might have been a little too slow–”

Already on his feet, Chu Wanning hurriedly made his way over to Mo Ran, big eyes staring up at his teacher as he clenched the older man’s robes.

“Shizun got harmed?” he inquired anxiously, not noticing how big his master’s pupils had blown or how ragged his breathing had turned. “Is Shizun okay? What can this disciple do to assist?”

“A-Ning,” Mo Ran’s voice lowered, distinctly rougher now. “Your Shizun is completely fine. There’s no need to worry. Just, ah, a minor inconvenience.”

Heart beating hard, Chu Wanning’s knuckles turned white as his grasp on Mo Ran’s robes tightened.

He knew well enough that his Shizun would never let him or his other disciples know if he was harmed in any way, too determined to not have them worrying over him.

He knew, because Mo Ran had once arrived at their sect with his robes in scraps and blood splattered all over his body, yet he’d still smiled and laughed heartily as the sect’s healers came running to help him, Chu Wanning right on their heels. Chu Wanning’s heart had been pounding so hard that he had almost puked, his small hand tightly curled around Mo Ran’s bigger and callused one as the latter tried to make him stop sniffling into his shoulder.

After that, Chu Wanning had been even less enthusiastic about his Shizun going on missions alone, shooting Mo Ran an ice-cold look every time he mentioned possibly doing so. Mo Ran himself had been a lot more understanding after that incident, though, now always letting Chu Wanning know that he was okay as soon as he returned to the sect – it was the first thing he did, actually, locating Chu Wanning and gently patting his head as he told him about his mission, Chu Wanning’s face red-flushed and complacent as he listened to his Shizun with rapt attention.

“If Shizun got hurt, then he needs proper treatment,” Chu Wanning stated, eyebrows furrowed and an anxious blush covering his face as he held Mo Ran’s stare. “Shizun needs to take care of himself.”

Lips curling slightly, Mo Ran’s dark eyes wandered over Chu Wanning’s face, making something warm pool in the latter’s stomach. Something warm and heady, something Chu Wanning did his best to ignore.

Lifting a large hand, Mo Ran used it to cup Chu Wanning’s jaw, a rough thumb brushing over a warm cheekbone.

“A-Ning is such a good boy,” Mo Ran drawled, the sound low and intimate. It sent a lick of cold up Chu Wanning’s spine. “Such a good disciple for his Shizun, mm?”

Chu Wanning didn’t even realize that he was panting slightly until he noticed that his mouth was open, the rest of him completely still, thoroughly focused on Mo Ran’s hand against his face. Enthralled by the way his Shizun’s thumb was petting him, slow and gentle.

“Mn,” Chu Wanning managed to breathe, face reddening even further as Mo Ran’s smile grew.

“A-Ning would do anything his Shizun asked him to, wouldn’t he?” Mo Ran crooned, stepping even closer to Chu Wanning.

The size difference between them made him tower over the brunette; Mo Ran, as a grown and matured cultivator, was tall and broad, his body muscled and strong. Chu Wanning was by no means small or weak, but his build was a lot leaner, with a slender waist and a slim figure, barely reaching his Shizun’s chin.

And now his Shizun was looking at Chu Wanning in a way that made Chu Wanning burn.

“Mn,” looking away, Chu Wanning barely managed to contain the shiver running through him at the way Mo Ran was gazing at him. He always got a lot of attention from his Shizun, an unfair amount one could even say, but never like this.

Never like his Shizun wanted to… To eat him.

“Shizun is acting very… Is Shizun… Is Shizun okay?”

Staring at him for a moment longer, Mo Ran suddenly cursed and released Chu Wanning’s chin, staggering a few steps back before turning his face away.

“A-Ning,” Mo Ran’s voice was suddenly sharp, a lot harsher than the smooth drawls he’d just let out. His hands were curling into fists as dark eyes stared at the floor next to them. “Go to your shixiong. Shizun will go take care of his condition, and you’ll stay with them until he is back. Understood?”

“But Shizun,” taking a step closer to Mo Ran, Chu Wanning couldn’t help the small whine leaving his throat. “This disciple wishes to help you.”

Lifting a dismissive hand, Mo Ran still refused to look at him as he gestured for Chu Wanning to stop moving. A twinge of something made Chu Wanning’s heart sink.

“Wanning,” Mo Ran’s jaw was tense as he spoke, his chest rising fast. “This is not something you can help your Shizun with. Be a good disciple and go to your shixiong, and we’ll talk about this tomorrow.”

Still refusing to listen, Chu Wanning moved even closer, lifting two slender, pale hands to clutch Mo Ran’s hand. It was warm against his touch, twitching slightly as he stared at his Shizun with sincere eyes.

“Why can’t this disciple assist Shizun?” he huffed, something petulant in his voice. He didn’t dare to meet Mo Ran’s stare, knowing that his master must be displeased with his disobedience, yet still unable to tolerate being brushed aside like that. “A-Ning would do anything to help his Shizun, especially if Shizun is in pain.”

Mo Ran’s fingers tensed up in Chu Wanning’s grasp, yet he didn’t try to pull his hand away. He didn’t answer, either, simply staring down at his disciple with an unreadable expression.

“Shizun,” Chu Wanning murmured pitifully, head bowing down slightly as he held on to his master’s palm. “Don’t… Don’t leave again, okay?”

A heavy inhale from Mo Ran made him jolt lightly, and then the fingers he was holding suddenly twisted to grab both of his hands, using the grip to tug Chu Wanning closer.

“Wanning, Wanning, Wanning,” Mo Ran’s voice was low and delicious as he murmured, “when did you turn so disobedient, mm?”

Burning up, Chu Wanning didn’t answer, his head still bent as he listened to his master’s heavy breathing. Getting pulled closer to Mo Ran, he noticed how warm his Shizun was in general, heat practically emitting from his body.

It made Chu Wanning’s own body turn all hot and strange, his thighs involuntarily pressing together.

“This disciple just wants to help,” he mumbled quietly, almost sulking. Mo Ran’s grasp around his hands tightened. “A-Ning just wants to assist Shizun.”

“Mm,” Mo Ran was breathing harshly now, dark purple eyes narrowing as he tugged Chu Wanning even closer. “Shizun knows. My A-Ning is always so helpful, always so eager to help.”

My A-Ning. Chu Wanning shivered.

“But this isn’t something a Shizun can have his disciple help him with,” Mo Ran continued, his crooning voice quiet and raspy. “A-Ning, the spirit your Shizun fought today… It’s a particularly vicious one, because it defends itself by transforming into someone its victim lusts for. It then uses the victim’s confusion and lack of defense to throw an especially, ah, stimulating type of pollen on them.”

Eyebrows scrunching up, Chu Wanning listened attentively to his Shizun, his hands still covered by Mo Ran’s.

“This pollen is from a particularly wicked plant species, the dust making its victim…” Mo Ran paused, dark eyes closing as he took a deep breath. “Wanning, it’s nothing dangerous. Shizun will just have to visit a specific location, and then I’ll be fine by tomorrow.”

Mo Ran’s jaw clenched as a drop of sweat trickled down his temple, a shudder running through him.

“Then can this disciple go with you?” Chu Wanning asked. “If Shizun simply needs to visit a special location, then why can’t A-Ning go with him?”

Opening his eyes again, Mo Ran’s stare was so heavy that Chu Wanning’s mouth went dry.

“Because a brothel is no place for a disciple of mine.”

The air between them went silent for a moment, with the exception of Mo Ran’s ragged breathing.

“A brothel,” Chu Wanning felt his gut drop. “Shizun needs to go to a brothel?”

Mo Ran’s teeth flashed.

“A-Ning,” he said, voice whetted into an edge, deep and sinful. “Your Shizun needs to fuck.”

Pure shock flashed across Chu Wanning’s face.

“S-Shizun needs to—”

Mo Ran tugged Chu Wanning all the way over to him, Chu Wanning’s shoulder bumping into his chest as Mo Ran inclined his head to whisper into his ear. His breath was hot against Chu Wanning’s skin.

“The spirit your Shizun encountered today weakens its prey by throwing a type of pollen on them that makes the victim so aroused that it hurts,” Mo Ran pulled his head back an inch, meeting Chu Wanning’s gaze and holding it. “The victim then dual cultivates with the spirit, not noticing that the spirit is feeding on them until it’s too late. Your Shizun killed the spirit, but he still has the need to dual cultivate. If he doesn’t do so, he might end up getting harmed by the pollen itself.”

Panting hard, Chu Wanning stared right into his Shizun’s eyes, unable to look away. They were so dark that they seemed black, something heavy and outright hungry inside of them.

His Shizun needed to—

His Shizun needed to dual cultivate with someone?

“Oh,” Chu Wanning breathed.

Mo Ran’s eyes flickered between both of Chu Wanning’s.

“Precisely,” Mo Ran said, something akin to finality in his words. “And that’s why Wanning can’t join his Shizun.”

Letting go off Chu Wanning’s hands, Mo Ran took a few steps back, looking like he was ready to walk out of the inn again.

Chu Wanning’s heart jumped, and then he rushed forward, slim fingers immediately grabbing hold of his Shizun’s robes again, pulling him closer. With furrowed eyebrows and red ears, Chu Wanning looked up at Mo Ran with determination.

“Shizun shouldn’t… Shizun shouldn’t go to other people to get help with his affliction,” he stuttered, grey eyes big and sincere as Mo Ran stared at him with an unreadable expression. “Shizun should let this disciple help him instead.”

Glancing down at how tightly Chu Wanning was clutching onto his robes, Mo Ran inhaled softly before letting a finger run along Chu Wanning’s chin.

“A-Ning,” he said gently. “Do you realize what you’re offering? Does A-Ning realize what dual cultivation involves?”

His finger grazed the skin right beneath Chu Wanning’s lips, barely skimming his pale-pink bottom lip. Chu Wanning hardly noticed, though, too occupied by the ear-deafening volume of his heartbeat.

“I do,” Chu Wanning breathed.

A flicker of something flashed across Mo Ran’s features, and then suddenly he let go off Chu Wanning’s face again, moving past him towards the stairs to the second floor. Although his walk came across as a saunter, smooth and self-assured, there was something strange about the way his hips moved.

…It was almost as if there were something in his pants hindering him from walking normally.

“Let’s discuss this further in my room.”

🍦

Chu Wanning wasn’t sure what he had expected to happen when he entered his Shizun’s room, but it was not for Mo Ran to pull out a chair and sit down on it. He would probably have admired the lazy, almost arrogant way Mo Ran was lounging on it, if not for the clear evidence of how badly his Shizun was actually afflicted by the pollen.

Mo Ran always wore practical robes, well-fitting and with few layers, in beautiful black and navy colors. Chu Wanning usually marveled at how well they suited his Shizun; the way they clung to his shoulders and his back, showing off a lean, muscular waist.

Now they weren’t only clinging to his upper body, but also to the massive thing tenting his pants, making the fabric stand out obscenely. Staring at it, Chu Wanning could even see how it twitched.

A low groan from Mo Ran made his head snap up, his already red cheeks darkening further as Chu Wanning realized that his Shizun had seen him ogling his–

Oh.

“Staring,” Mo Ran’s voice was barely a rasp, “…does not help.”

Chu Wanning’s fingers curled into his own robes as he felt his body shiver, heat pooling in his lower abdomen. He was well-aware that both his cheeks and his ears were burning, his eyebrows sharp and furrowed with embarrassment as he waited for his Shizun’s instructions.

Until realization hit him.

Chu Wanning wasn’t going to get any instructions. His Shizun had barely allowed him to assist him at all, thoroughly making it clear which solution he originally preferred.

Taking a deep breath, Chu Wanning forced his fingers to let go off his robes.

If he wanted to help his Shizun… Then he had to take the initiative.

Glancing up, Chu Wanning took in Mo Ran again, swallowing when he realized how his Shizun had been staring at him the entire time. Those violet eyes of his dark and attentive, following his every move as Chu Wanning stepped closer.

Feeling heavy with embarrassment, excitement and something that made his lower gut throb, Chu Wanning walked over and climbed into his Shizun’s lap, barely daring to look at the older man as he settled on top of his–

On top of his Shizun’s cock.

It was hard, achingly hard, against Chu Wanning’s rear, pressing right against the cleft of his ass. Even through multiple layers of robes, he could still swear that he could feel how warm it was.

“Fuck,” swearing, Mo Ran slid his hands to encompass Chu Wanning’s waist, his hips involuntarily pushing up against his disciple as he grinded his erection against Chu Wanning’s ass.

“Fuck, A-Ning, you have to be really sure about this, ‘cus, shit–” another moan, this one dark and low, making goosebumps pop up on Chu Wanning’s skin, “when I start fucking you, I don’t think I can stop.”

Whimpering, Chu Wanning looped his arms around Mo Ran’s neck and pressed his burning face against his Shizun’s throat, barely resisting the urge to press down against Mo Ran’s cock.

“I’m sure,” he breathed quietly, a whine escaping his throat. “A-Ning wants to help his Shizun.”

Cursing hard, Mo Ran’s hips buckled again, this time accompanied by his hands around Chu Wanning’s midriff pulling the latter down, allowing him to properly hump his disciple’s ass.

“A-Ning is so good,” he bit out, letting one of his hands slip down to squeeze Chu Wanning’s buttcheeks, prompting a gasp out of Chu Wanning and an answering groan out of Mo Ran.

“Fuck, always so sweet and obedient for your Shizun, always looking at me with those pretty eyes, making me wonder what they’d look like filled up with tears.”

Trembling slightly, Chu Wanning whined into Mo Ran’s shoulder at the filthy words leaving his Shizun’s mouth.

“A-Ning,” Mo Ran breathed darkly. “Baobei. My sweet, precious disciple.” His hands kept roaming over Chu Wanning’s body, as if they were desperate to touch every single place at once, needing to feel just how soft and slender Chu Wanning’s body was. “Have you ever tried dual cultivation before?”

One of his hands slipped into Chu Wanning’s hair, curling a few locks around his fingers as he pulled on it so he could whisper into his disciple’s ear. “If you say yes, I’m going to slaughter whoever has put their greedy little hands on you.”

Chu Wanning shivered so badly that he jolted, a severe sensation of arousal, of delight, of pride filling him.

“Never,” he whimpered, allowing Mo Ran to tug his head back so his Shizun could look at him. “A-Ning has never been with anyone, not in any way. I only… I only want Shizun.”

A fierce look of glee filled Mo Ran’s eyes; something primal, something exceedingly possessive and greedy. Something that made his eyes glow with excitement, which in turn made Chu Wanning’s stomach swoop.

“Good,” Mo Ran’s voice had dropped into a whisper, satisfaction making his lips curl. “I want to be Wanning’s first and Wanning’s only.”

“Yes,” Chu Wanning couldn’t help the moan leaving him at the idea. “A-Ning doesn’t want anyone but Shizun. Shizun can do whatever he wants to me– to this disciple.”

Mo Ran let out a soft snarl, and then he was tugging Chu Wanning into a kiss, licking into his mouth with some sense of despair. It was lewd and hot and wet, and Chu Wanning whimpered as he tasted his Shizun for the first time.

Mo Ran tasted good. His tongue was eager yet gentle, switching between sucking on Chu Wanning’s tongue and rubbing his own against it, fingers fisted into Chu Wanning’s hair to keep him from shifting away; as if that was something Chu Wanning would have the urge to do.

Moaning, Chu Wanning obediently angled his head as Mo Ran kept greedily kissing him, a certain possessiveness in the gesture that made his bones tingle. He could feel spit trickling down the corner of his mouth, but he couldn’t make himself care, not with how Mo Ran was kissing and touching and enjoying him.

“Fuck,” breaking apart their lips, Mo Ran’s breaths were harsh as he kept grinding up against Chu Wanning, “you taste so fucking lush, Wanning, shit.” Another sharp inhale, and then his other hand slipped into Chu Wanning’s robes, fishing around until he found the back of Chu Wanning’s pants where he—

“Oh!” keening, Chu Wanning’s arms tightened around Mo Ran’s neck again, eyes half-lidded as he stared at his Shizun’s face. “S-Shizun!”

A large, clever hand had slipped into his pants, immediately resting against the swell of Chu Wanning’s rear as a long finger darted in-between his buttcheeks. The tip of it started rubbing right against the spot where Chu Wanning was furled tight and hot.

Mo Ran’s cock twitched in his pants, a snarl in his voice as he spoke. “A-Ning, your Shizun is going to need you to be a good, obedient disciple for him one more time. Can you do that?”

Shuddering, Chu Wanning nodded, half-lidded eyes dazed as Mo Ran tugged him in for one more soft, warm kiss. It left his skin prickling pleasantly, all the way out to his fingertips.

“Good,” Mo Ran crooned. “Undress, get on the bed, and spread your ass for me. Shizun is feeling hungry.”

Startled, Chu Wanning felt white-hot heat fill his body, his eyes wide and face astonished as he stared at his master.

Mo Ran’s gaze raked over him, his finger still playing with Chu Wanning’s entrance. The motion was almost lazy – just slow, proprietary touches.

“Or has A-Ning decided to be disobedient again?” he hummed, eyes sparkling in the dimly lit room. “It’s your choice. Your Shizun wouldn’t mind having to rip A-Ning’s clothes off and bend him over the bed, if that’s what he has to do to fuck him.”

Swallowing hard, Chu Wanning quietly shook his head, feeling his heartbeat all the way up in his throat.

“N-no,” he murmured. “A-Ning will be good.”

Mo Ran’s dimples showed as he grinned, the curve of his lips smug and cheeky.

“Good,” he purred, carefully removing his hand from Chu Wanning’s pants before giving his ass a gentle squeeze. “Up you go.”

Feeling his face burn, Chu Wanning braced his hands on Mo Ran’s shoulders as he got up on shaky feet, catching a glimpse of the bulge in his teacher’s pants once more. There was now a pool of something damp right next to the outline of the tip of the erection.

Chu Wanning wondered what it tasted like.

Mo Ran must have noticed his stare, because his Shizun’s lips twitched as he cupped his cock, giving it a good squeeze. Moaning breathily, Mo Ran then slipped his thumbs underneath his waistband and shoved it down, baring his cock to the air.

Chu Wanning’s breath hitched, phoenix eyes widening as he took in the massive thing he had just been grinding against.

Ridiculously thick and ridiculously long, Mo Ran’s cock almost reminded Chu Wanning of his forearm. It was flushed red, the tip glistening with precome, and as Mo Ran loosely curled a big hand around it, a trickle of liquid ran down the side of the cock.

Stroking himself slowly, Mo Ran stared at Chu Wanning, those indigo eyes never leaving his disciple’s face.

“Does A-Ning like it?” he asked, something dark in his voice. “It’s all for you.”

Sliding his hand up to only fist the head of his cock, Mo Ran fucked into it with a few heavy thrusts, his jaw tensing up at the friction. Then, grabbing his cock with his left hand instead, Mo Ran opened his right palm and showed off the precome gathered there, slowly dripping down onto the floor.

“Every single drop,” Mo Ran murmured quietly, still eyeing Chu Wanning. “All for you.”

Chu Wanning shivered, then started disrobing himself with clumsy hands. Turning slightly to the side, he didn’t dare look at his Shizun as he removed his outer robes, inelegantly folding them and putting them to the side before continuing to undress. The room was completely silent with the exception of quiet, ragged breaths and a wet, sloppy sound.

Pausing for a moment, Chu Wanning threw a shy glance over his shoulder.

And immediately found Mo Ran staring at him, fist sliding up and down his cock as he watched Chu Wanning strip for him. Meeting Chu Wanning’s eyes, Mo Ran’s lips curved.

“A-Ning is doing so well,” he purred, fucking his hand harder. “Keep going. You’re being very good for your Shizun.”

Flustered, Chu Wanning’s head snapped back as fumbling hands started to tug on his inner robes. His heart was thundering in his chest, mouth feeling dry as he slowly opened his robes, baring himself to the cool air in the room. It was a pleasant contrast to the heat burning inside of him.

The floorboards creaked behind him, and then a big body embraced him from behind, a warm, thick length nudging intently against his ass.

His Shizun’s– His Shizun’s cock.

“Look at you,” Mo Ran breathed into his ear, chin resting on Chu Wanning’s shoulder as purple eyes gazed down at his disciple’s body. Taking in the slender muscles visible between Chu Wanning’s open robes, the flushed skin on his chest, the stiff, pink nipples.

The bulge in his pants.

Perhaps not as impressive as Mo Ran’s, but still very much visible and leaking. It had been there ever since Mo Ran cupped Chu Wanning’s face and called him a good boy.

Sucking in a breath through his teeth, Mo Ran seemed to notice it as well, one of his hands slipping down to cup it. Chu Wanning jolted at the sensation. His hips reflexively pushed forward, straining to get better friction, desperate for some sort of release.

“Fuck,” Mo Ran snarled as Chu Wanning let out a quiet moan. Rubbing his palm against Chu Wanning’s cock, he must’ve noticed how his disciple was starting to rest heavily against him, knees already growing weak at the stimuli. “You’re soaked.”

A whimper escaped Chu Wanning’s lips and he closed his eyes, pressing them together so he didn’t have to see how correct his Shizun was.

“S-Shizun,” he murmured pitifully.

“Mm,” concentration was evident in Mo Ran’s voice as clever fingers started to caress Chu Wanning’s cock through his pants, running up and down his length before suddenly playing with the tip, thumbing the slit.

Chu Wanning made a punched-out sound, body jolting and mouth wide open. Gasping, he tried to squirm away from the intense sensations running through him, but his Shizun’s arms tightened around his frame, easily hindering him from moving.

“Shizun, I– Shizun!” blinking, Chu Wanning could feel tears filling up his eyes. Having someone play with his sensitive areas like this, touching and groping and fondling… It felt so… Oh.

“A-Ning,” Mo Ran crooned, fingertips gently rubbing at the base of Chu Wanning’s cock before slipping up to squeeze the head. “Won’t you let your Shizun take care of you, hm?”

Shivering, Chu Wanning couldn’t hold it any longer. Feeling his Shizun’s warm breath against his ear, feeling his Shizun’s hand touch him down there…

A single twitch of his cock, and then he was coming, body shivering with the force of it. He was aware that he was making some sort of noise but he had no idea what, too occupied with grabbing his Shizun’s arms and holding on to him, knees buckling under the sudden pleasure.

Not that he had anything to worry about – strong arms immediately hugged him tighter, holding him upright as a skillful hand worked him through the hardest orgasm of his life.

A sharp inhale next to his ear made Chu Wanning shudder.

“Good thing your Shizun put up a sound barrier,” Mo Ran’s voice was low and dark, something possessive in his tone as he pushed his lips against Chu Wanning’s jaw, his throat, his ear. “If someone else heard A-Ning like that, Shizun would have to kill them.”

Arousal shot through Chu Wanning like lightning. Still shivering from his orgasm, he didn’t protest at all as Mo Ran stopped rubbing his cock, instead dipping his fingers inside Chu Wanning’s pants to pull the fabric out from his skin. Allowing both of them to see the mess he’d made inside.

Snapping his eyes shut again, Chu Wanning could feel Mo Ran’s arm tighten even more around his waist.

“What a mess my sweet disciple has made,” Mo Ran murmured quietly, erection pushing against Chu Wanning’s ass as he stared at the pool of cum inside his disciple’s pants. “So much, and so fast. Is A-Ning not used to touching himself?”

Chu Wanning’s cheeks burned.

“I… It’s dirty,” he mumbled, voice small and quiet.

Mo Ran paused for a moment.

“…But A-Ning has orgasmed before?” he asked after a moment, something dark in his voice again.

Still red-faced, Chu Wanning gave a slight nod. Mo Ran’s cock twitched against his buttcheeks.

“Yeah?” Mo Ran was back to purring, his fingers slipping down to swipe through the spilled cum. “Tell Shizun how it was. What did A-Ning think about?”

Opening his eyes slightly, Chu Wanning caught a glimpse of Mo Ran’s hand disappearing from his pants, up to his–

To his mouth.

Watching Chu Wanning, Mo Ran casually opened his mouth and sucked on his fingers, holding his disciple’s stare as he groaned heavily.

“Mm, that’s good,” he moaned, purple eyes darkening. “My A-Ning tastes so sweet and lush. Makes Shizun wonder what other parts of him tastes like.”

Going scarlet, Chu Wanning almost squeaked as Mo Ran suddenly lifted him and carried him towards the bed, gently placing the younger man on top of it. With something restless and hungry in his face, Mo Ran wasted no time flinging aside Chu Wanning’s inner robes, swiftly peeling off his pants as well.

Glancing over his shoulder at his Shizun, Chu Wanning’s hands clenched up at the realization that he was stark naked, all pale and pink and shiny with sweat, whilst Mo Ran was still fully dressed. He’d even tucked his erection back inside, the outline of his dick against his pants thick and obscene.

“…Shizun,” feeling slightly peeved over being so exposed, Chu Wanning couldn’t help the whine in his voice. Mo Ran’s eyes flashed, and then he was all over Chu Wanning, urging him forwards to rest on his chest with a warm hand against his back.

“Baobei,” Mo Ran cooed. “Be a good boy and hold still for your Shizun, mm?”

Letting out a mere huff in reply, Chu Wanning barely had the time to feel embarrassed about the humiliating position his Shizun had put him in – ass up in the air, face and chest against the sheets – before two hands grabbed hold of his ass, kneading and squeezing the soft, plush skin with a certain greediness.

Chu Wanning’s eyes widened, his mouth shaping a small ‘o’.

Seconds after, the thumbs of those hands parted his ass, showing off his–

His–!

Pink and tight and soft, Chu Wanning’s entrance was put on display for his Shizun. And two seconds later, a fierce shiver ran through his body as Mo Ran let a broad, wet tongue run over Chu Wanning’s hole.

It wasn’t just a single lick – letting out a jagged breath, Mo Ran clutched Chu Wanning’s ass bruisingly hard and started lapping at his entrance with the fervency of a starving man. Sloppy, watery noises soon started to sound throughout the room as Mo Ran ate his disciple out with passion, moaning and groaning as he tasted the younger man on his tongue.

Chu Wanning, on the other hand, could barely hold on – fingers white-knuckled against the sheets, he had no choice but to bury his face into the pillow, grey eyes rolling back as he bit and whimpered into the soft material. Thoroughly overwhelmed with the new sensation, especially so soon after his orgasm, Chu Wanning didn’t even notice that he was fully hard again before he realized that he was leaking against the mattress, sticky precome making the fabric cling to him.

“Sh–zun,” he keened into the pillow, body arching under the intent attention of Mo Ran’s mouth.

The latter simply groaned, tongue moving to rub determinedly against Chu Wanning’s entrance. Little by little the tight furl started to loosen up, allowing Mo Ran to lick half an inch or so inside his disciple.

Pulling back, Mo Ran let out a shuddering exhale, a big palm moving up to wipe his lower face. “Fuck,” teeth flashing, Mo Ran pulled his dick back out of his robes, giving himself seven-eight rough strokes. “A-Ning, give Shizun your hands.”

Still holding tightly onto the bed sheets, body stiff with tingling nerves and burning arousal, Chu Wanning could merely whine pitifully as Mo Ran bent over him and loosened his fists with careful fingers.

“Good boy,” Mo Ran breathed, pressing a wet kiss to Chu Wanning’s shoulder before sitting back again. “Here, baobei, hold here.”

Guiding Chu Wanning’s fingers, Mo Ran made them rest where he had just used his own hands to hold his disciple open. Letting go, he watched Chu Wanning spread himself open for him for a minute, cock leaking heavily at the tantalizing sight.

Dark eyes sparkling, Mo Ran then got up on his knees to press his dick against Chu Wanning’s entrance. Barely stretched open, the hole didn’t budge at all, not even as Mo Ran gently pressed forward.

Shaking, Chu Wanning spit the pillow out of his mouth, looking at his Shizun over his shoulder with teary eyes.

“Shizun, it won’t… It won’t fit,” he whimpered, the feeling of Mo Ran’s cock against his entrance enough alone to fill him with a sense of intimidation. “This disciple… A-Ning is too tight...”

Jaw clenching, Mo Ran couldn’t help grinding up against Chu Wanning’s hole, watching his cock slip between the slick cleft of his disciple’s ass.

“A-Ning is perfect,” Mo Ran muttered darkly, licking his lips as he started working his cock with a hand again, the movement harsh and hurried. “…And your Shizun can’t wait to have A-Ning clenching around his cock, listening to A-Ning’s sweet, sweet sounds.”

Sniffling, Chu Wanning felt his own dick twitch as his Shizun hungrily fucked his fist, the tip of his cock pushing against Chu Wanning’s hole every time Mo Ran thrusted forward.

It didn’t take long – some heavy thrusts, a smack of Chu Wanning’s ass and an answering moan, and then Mo Ran was coming all over Chu Wanning’s hands and rear, letting out a toe-curlingly rough moan. Warm, viscous cum immediately started trickling down Chu Wanning’s thighs, down his fingers, even down his balls.

Chu Wanning didn’t mind it one bit. It felt like Mo Ran was claiming ownership of him, and it made him so hard that he ached.

Cursing harshly, Mo Ran instantly pressed his thumb against Chu Wanning’s entrance, massaging his cum into it with an intent finger before it finally started to give beneath his touch. Chu Wanning gasped and arched his back as Mo Ran slowly and gently pushed his thumb inside him, a pitiful moan leaving his throat as the first knuckle slipped in.

Mo Ran’s eyes were so dark that they came across as black.

“You’re squeezing around me,” he said huskily. “I’ve barely put a finger inside you, and you’re clenching around it as if you’re being fucked by a thick, hard cock.” Moving his finger in and out slowly, Mo Ran seemed to go slightly unhinged, his eyes glued to the place he was fucking Chu Wanning open.

Muffling a whimper, Chu Wanning bit into the pillow and tried to keep himself from pushing back into his Shizun’s lovely, wicked fingers.

It felt good. It felt so, so good to be worked open by his Shizun, to have fingers touch him somewhere he had never thought to reach into before. Added with how he had to spread himself open for his Shizun to touch him like that, how he could still feel his Shizun’s cum dry on his ass, on his thighs, on his hands–

Mo Ran hadn’t touched his cock once since Chu Wanning came, yet he was already so close to coming again that he was twitching.

“Such a good boy,” Mo Ran purred, a second finger making its way into his disciple. Slow and gentle at first, then slightly faster as he loosened Chu Wanning’s tight, completely untouched hole, preparing it to be fucked by the iron-hard cock throbbing between Mo Ran’s legs.

Two fingers turned into three, and Chu Wanning was squirming as Mo Ran’s large fingers pushed into him, the slide of them so good, so tight, so addictive. Eyes rolling back, he couldn’t stop the needy pants leaving his chest for every press of that skillful hand.

“A-Ning,” Mo Ran breathed. “Let Shizun show you something fun.”

Chu Wanning could barely process the words before Mo Ran curled his fingers, pressing them against a new spot inside of him.

Mouth popping open in a silent moan, Chu Wanning came again. Just like that; just from the smooth, gentle push of Mo Ran’s fingers and a flick against his prostate.

Hissing, Mo Ran kept pumping his fingers inside as Chu Wanning shook, squirmed, mewled and whined, twitching around his fingers as spine-melting pleasure hit him.

“ShizunShizunShizun,” the chanter was barely audible as Chu Wanning whimpered into his pillow, tears soaking the fabric along with spit and sweat. “Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-!”

The bed creaked underneath him, and then Mo Ran was hovering over him, lips pressing soothing kisses against Chu Wanning’s neck as he guided his cock to rest against his entrance again. This time, the first inch of the head slipped inside without further prompting, the slickness of Mo Ran’s cum making Chu Wanning’s entrance slippery and wet.

“A-Ning,” he cooed quietly. “Wanning. Baobei. Sweetheart, will you let your Shizun inside now?”

Swallowing harshly, Chu Wanning nodded shakily, tingles running down his spine as Mo Ran pushed a little harder against him.

“Good boy,” Mo Ran murmured, then moved his fingers to tap Chu Wanning’s hands; they were still holding onto his ass with white-knuckled intensity. “Use them to hold onto your pillow instead. I don’t want to hurt them whilst I’m fucking you.”

Shivering, Chu Wanning barely managed to let go, his fingers all stiff and tired after holding on so tightly. Mo Ran patiently waited as Chu Wanning moved his hands up to clutch his pillow instead, before he settled further down on top of his disciple’s back and grasped his cock again, making sure that cum was spread all over it.

“Tell me if it’s too much,” he breathed, and then he pushed.

And he pushed, and pushed, and pushed, the thick cock between his thighs slowly filling Chu Wanning up to the brim, then even further. The spilled cum made the slide smoother, but Mo Ran’s movements were still unhurried as he worked his disciple’s ass open.

Chu Wanning went limp, then shuddered and gasped weakly into his pillow as he felt something so big, so hard fuck into him. Just on the edge of being too much, he could feel shivers running up and down his spine as Mo Ran breathed heavily next to his ear.

“A-Ning is doing so well,” his Shizun praised, hissing slightly as Chu Wanning tightened even further around him. “That’s it, baobei, that’s almost all of it.”

Almost all of it.

Squinting through wet lashes, Chu Wanning whimpered as Mo Ran’s hands slid to grab his hips, his touch warm and rough.

“So good, baobei,” Mo Ran crooned, pulling out till only the tip of his cock rested inside Chu Wanning’s ass. Smearing more cum on the rest of his length, Mo Ran then pushed inside again, the movement faster and rougher now, his balls gently nudging against Chu Wanning’s ass as he bottomed out.

Chu Wanning stiffened, a shaky cry escaping his throat as his body struggled to arrange itself around the ridiculously fat cock pushed inside of him.

“Sh-Shizun,” he whined pitifully, clenching weakly around Mo Ran’s dick.

Something glinted in dark lilac eyes.

“Don’t call me that,” Mo Ran’s voice was dark and quiet as he whispered into Chu Wanning’s ear, grabbing his waist bruisingly hard. “Baobei should call me gege.”

Then, suddenly pulling out of Chu Wanning’s ass, Mo Ran gritted his teeth and slammed his cock back into his disciple, prompting a lewd moan out of Chu Wanning.

“Shiz– Gege!” gasping for breath, Chu Wanning went limp again as Mo Ran started properly fucking him, thrusts impatient and hard.

“Yes, baobei,” Mo Ran hissed, pulling Chu Wanning back with every snap of his hips. “Let your Mo Ran-gege know how good it feels.”

Whimpering, Chu Wanning bit into his pillow, goosebumps popping up on his skin as Mo Ran’s cock kept rubbing against his prostate. “M-Mo Ran-gege,” he sniffled, then gasped and arched his back as Mo Ran slammed into him harder, pinning him down against the bed.

“Yeah,” panting, Mo Ran felt his self-restraint slip away as he started to fuck Chu Wanning just as hard as he had dreamed about doing, their bodies slapping together as he railed his disciple.

Scooting up the bed with each of Mo Ran’s thrusts, Chu Wanning kept whimpering and sniveling into his pillow. Those watery eyes of his were completely shut, all of his attention zeroing in on the spot where his Shizun was burying himself inside him, squeezing helplessly around the length entering him.

“So fucking good,” Mo Ran moaned, eyebrows furrowing as he covered Chu Wanning’s body with his own. “Fuck, I’m going to breed you so well, baobei.”

Slipping a hand into Chu Wanning’s hair, Mo Ran easily tugged his disciple’s head to the side so he could take a look at Chu Wanning’s flushed, teary face, noticing the whimper the latter let out. “Do you like that, baobei? Do you want your gege to knock you up?”

Chu Wanning didn’t answer. Instead, as Mo Ran yanked him back against his cock particularly hard, grey eyes went dazed as Chu Wanning shivered and came.

Greedy satisfaction sparkled in Mo Ran’s eyes as Chu Wanning let out a needy moan, body trembling as he made a complete mess of the sheets underneath them. His cock twitched pitifully, the lack of a helping hand around it making Chu Wanning’s orgasm long and intense.

“Look at you,” Mo Ran groaned. “Fuck, baobei, let me–“

Snapping his hips even harder, Chu Wanning outright sobbed as Mo Ran fucked him into the bed. Brain still lost in a strange, blissful haze, he could barely notice the creaking of the bedframe over the slapping of their bodies.

“Gege–“ drooling into his pillow, Chu Wanning’s eyes turned half-lidded as Mo Ran rammed into his prostate, large hands digging into pale, soft hips.

“Yeah,” breathless and distracted, Mo Ran was panting hard against Chu Wanning’s neck, focused on nothing else but the tight, warm squeeze of Chu Wanning’s ass around his cock. “Shit, I’m going to–“

Another snap of his hips, and then Mo Ran was coming hard, spilling deep, deep inside of his disciple. Moaning fiercely, Mo Ran kept fucking into Chu Wanning, filling him with bursts of warm, viscous cum, pushing it as far inside as possible.

Sobbing, Chu Wanning couldn’t believe that the hot sensation he was feeling inside was his Shizun’s cum – his Shizun’s cum! – before he was tugged up from the sheets, Mo Ran still pushing into him as he urged Chu Wanning to meet his gaze.

“Baobei,” he cooed, pressing soft kisses against Chu Wanning’s jaw. “A-Ning, look at me.”

Chu Wanning sniffled, then turned his head to shoot a pouty look towards his Shizun. He knew exactly how much of a mess he probably looked like; long hair all mussed up and tangled, cheeks pink and wet with tears and sweat, and lips bruised from kissing and biting them too much.

Mo Ran stared at him for a moment, a finger moving up to push some of Chu Wanning’s hair behind his ear.

“Baobei,” Mo Ran murmured, “look at you.”

Shame started to fill Chu Wanning’s stomach, along with a sense of embarrassment and humiliation. But then–

“So fucking perfect,” Mo Ran’s voice was quiet and husky. “Fuck, what a piece of art you are.”

One of his hands slipped down to play with Chu Wanning’s nipples, a breathy chuckle sounding as Chu Wanning whimpered at the sensation. Then, that same hand moved down to gently cup Chu Wanning’s spent cock, tenderly coaxing it back into hardness.

Pressing soft kisses against his disciple’s lower lip, Mo Ran kept fucking into him with slow, deep thrusts, his cock still hard as stone. The squelch of his cum inside of Chu Wanning provided a lewd background noise.

“Baobei, sweetheart,” Mo Ran said gently. Chu Wanning whined weakly, head tilting up to follow Mo Ran’s mouth over his shoulder.

Smiling, Mo Ran kissed him again, indulgently licking into Chu Wanning’s mouth for a moment before pulling back. “Baobei,” he murmured, “I’m going to continue fucking you now.”

Shuddering, Chu Wanning dazedly watched as Mo Ran pulled out of him, a gush of cum trickling out after his cock, and then proceeded to flip Chu Wanning around so they were chest to chest. The contrast of their skin, Mo Ran’s sunkissed and scarred in some places, Chu Wanning’s pale and spotless, was evident as Mo Ran gently placed Chu Wanning on top of his lap, brows knitting as the younger man slid all the way down on his cock.

Tearing up, Chu Wanning hurriedly braced his hands on Mo Ran’s shoulders and almost floundered off his lap at the overwhelming sensation of getting filled so thoroughly.

“Mo Ran-gege,” sniffling pitifully, Chu Wanning couldn’t help the lewd moan leaving him as Mo Ran slowly rolled his hips upwards.

“Baobei,” Mo Ran purred. Heat bloomed in the pit of his stomach at the sight in front of him – Chu Wanning’s eyes red-rimmed and brimming with tears, his lips wobbly and pink, saliva gleaming on them. Looking so deliciously bullyable.

Feeling the sex pollen urge him to taketaketake, Mo Ran grabbed Chu Wanning’s narrow waist and started fucking into him with fervor again, desperate to bury himself as far inside as possible.

Crying out, Chu Wanning threw his arms around Mo Ran’s neck and held on for dear life, muffling a whimper as Mo Ran snapped into him. Bouncing on his Shizun’s dick, he could hardly believe how it was possible to feel so many things at once.

Pleasure. Sensitivity. A crushing sense of urgency to make his Shizun feel good, so good he’d never want anyone but Chu Wanning again. Of getting so thoroughly filled, the sensation reaching all the way up to his gut.

Eyes rolling back, Chu Wanning could feel it as Mo Ran changed his position a little, the shift in his thrusts allowing him to grind against Chu Wanning’s prostate with every move. A weak noise left Chu Wanning’s lips.

“Gege,” he croaked, and then he was coming again, spilling weakly over Mo Ran’s abdomen. Having already orgasmed twice, his orgasm left him shuddering and sensitive; if not for his cultivation, he’d surely faint at the over-sensitivity running through him, feeling both spine-meltingly good and utterly wrecked at the same time.

Still making Chu Wanning bounce on his cock, Mo Ran grabbed his waist harder and started fucking his disciple even faster, hips slamming into Chu Wanning’s ass with every thrust.

“Fuck,” Mo Ran snarled, pushing his face into Chu Wanning’s sweaty hair as his pace turned brutal. “Fuck, you’re tight.”

Sobbing weakly, Chu Wanning could only clutch onto Mo Ran with shaky arms as his Shizun rutted into him like an animal in heat, breath turning ragged and heavy when he finally reached that edge again.

“Yeah,” Mo Ran breathed, “yesyesyes–“

Groaning, he tugged Chu Wanning’s body flush against his as his hips stuttered and he came. His cock throbbed as he filled his disciple up once more, pulsating heavily as Mo Ran kept fucking his cum into Chu Wanning.

The latter barely noticed – his fingers were buried into Mo Ran’s back, toes curled as overstimulation had him whimpering and crying.

“Gege,” Chu Wanning sobbed into Mo Ran’s neck. “T-too much, too much!”

Lips twitching, Mo Ran inclined his head to coo sweetly into Chu Wanning’s ear.

“But it feels so good, doesn’t it, baobei?” he murmured lovingly. “Look at how well you’re taking your gege, how you’re taking your gege’s cum. Baobei is going to look so good when gege is finished with him, filled to the brink with gege’s cum, mm?”

Sniffling, Chu Wanning couldn’t help the way he tightened around Mo Ran’s cock in response to those filthy words. His Shizun was still hard and warm inside of him, the movements of his hips almost completely slowed down now.

“…Gege,” Chu Wanning mumbled pitifully.

“Mm,” Mo Ran hummed, coaxing Chu Wanning to pull away from his throat so he could kiss him softly. The kiss was wet and salty with Chu Wanning’s tears. “A-Ning is so good for his Mo Ran-gege, he takes him so well. Look, baobei, look how well you’re doing.”

Following Mo Ran’s gaze, Chu Wanning went both hot and cold at the same time as he glanced down between them. Both of their abdomens were messy with the cum he had spilled earlier, but that wasn’t what Mo Ran was looking at.

Moving his hand down, Mo Ran gently slid his palm against Chu Wanning’s lower stomach, smoothing it over the slightest soft swell of his skin.

“Look at that, baobei,” Mo Ran murmured huskily. “Do you think it’s because of my cock? Or is it because your gege has fucked you so well, already filling you up twice?”

Flushing with red-hot heat, Chu Wanning felt too shy to answer, yet was too fascinated to look away.

Lowering one of his own hands, he let it rest next to Mo Ran’s, feeling the way his abdomen was bulging slightly. It made him involuntarily clench around the cock still inside of him.

Mo Ran must’ve noticed, judging from the quiet chuckle leaving his mouth. He didn’t speak, though, instead continuing to watch as Chu Wanning pulled his hand away, glancing at the cum that was now sticking to his fingers.

Slick and wet, it wasn’t entirely new to Chu Wanning, though he was usually used to feeling a lot more embarrassed over it.

Now, though, having his Shizun watch him intently as Chu Wanning inspected his own cum…

A shiver ran through him.

“Baobei,” Mo Ran crooned, pressing a kiss to Chu Wanning’s temple. “You never answered earlier, when gege asked what you think about when you touch yourself.” His clutch around Chu Wanning’s waist tightened, bruises surely adorning the skin beneath his hands. Voice darkening, Mo Ran’s stare turned heavier. “Won’t you tell gege, hm?”

Blushing, Chu Wanning looked away, bashfulness leaving him coy.

Mo Ran’s lips curled.

“Baobei,” he cooed. “A-Ning. Wanning.”

Still embarrassed, Chu Wanning didn’t reply. Mo Ran’s eyes darkened.

“Chu Wanning,” he drawled, noticing the way his disciple shuddered. “Your Shizun asked you a question.”

Strangling a whimper, Chu Wanning closed his eyes and felt his face burn as he answered.

“Shizun,” he mumbled. “When this disciple… I think about Shizun.”

A triumphant grin grew on Mo Ran’s face. Lifting a finger, he used it to tilt Chu Wanning’s head towards him again, relishing in the luscious blush on his disciple’s cheeks.

“Is that so,” he breathed, dark purple eyes sparkling with glee.

Chu Wanning’s bottom lip trembled slightly. Feeling entirely too self-conscious about having all of his Shizun’s attention on him, he realized that he’d need a distraction to shift it to something else instead.

Therefore, with cum still drying on his fingertips, Chu Wanning lifted his hand and tucked his fingers between his lips, just like his Shizun had done earlier.

Not only for distraction purposes, but also because… He had been curious.

Mo Ran’s eyes widened, his breath stuttering as he watched his disciple suck on his fingers, Chu Wanning blinking slowly as he got used to the new taste.

It wasn’t bad. Though slightly bitter, it actually tasted somewhat sweet as well. It made Chu Wanning wonder what his Shizun’s cum tasted like.

“Wanning,” Mo Ran’s stare was burning. “Oh, sweet, innocent, lovely baobei. What am I going to do with you?”

Gasping, Chu Wanning didn’t have time to reply before Mo Ran pushed him down on top of the sheets and started ramming into him with a feral, slightly unhinged expression on his face.

“W-wait!” mewling, Chu Wanning could barely speak as his Shizun’s hips jackhammered into his ass. “S-Shizun! Slow down, s-slow down!”

Too into it to stop, Mo Ran simply licked into his disciple’s mouth, their kiss wet and sloppy with tears and spit as he kept railing Chu Wanning. Bedframe slamming against the wall behind it, both of them were too occupied to realize how it was starting to break.

With his back arching, Chu Wanning could merely hold on to Mo Ran’s shoulders as the latter thrusted deeper and deeper, a slick sound spreading throughout the room as cum started to leak out of Chu Wanning’s hole.

“Shizun!” Chu Wanning sobbed as another orgasmed rushed through him, tears running freely. “Oh, oh, oh, oh-!”

Humming gently, Mo Ran pressed soothing kisses against Chu Wanning’s cheek as he slipped his hands underneath his disciple’s ass, practically pulling Chu Wanning into his lap to fuck him deeper.

“Baobei,” Mo Ran murmured. “Be a good disciple and let your Shizun breed you, hm?”

Letting out a combination of a wail and a moan, Chu Wanning curled his legs around Mo Ran’s strong waist, clinging onto him as he allowed his Shizun to relentlessly take him apart on that tiny bed, fucking Chu Wanning as if he could actually put a child into him.

🍦

They ended up fucking the entire night. The sex pollen and the sight of a fucked-out, messy Chu Wanning turned out to leave Mo Ran’s cock unable to soften.

Thus, every time he had orgasmed inside of Chu Wanning and slowed down to simply kiss the younger man for a little while, a breathy moan or a shudder running through Chu Wanning’s body was enough to make Mo Ran’s hands reach for his disciple’s waist to flip him over and fuck into him again.

And no matter how much Chu Wanning was crying, mewling and begging for Mo Ran to slow down, sobbing that it was ‘too much, too much’, he still looked outright insulted when Mo Ran suggested that he could leave the inn for an hour or two to give Chu Wanning a breather.

“This disciple is currently assisting Shizun,” Chu Wanning had mumbled, something whiny and petulant in his voice. “Why would Shizun leave?”

Now, after a mere thirty minutes of dozing against Mo Ran’s shoulder, Chu Wanning looked soft and tired and so, so beautiful. His entire body was adorned with bruises from Mo Ran’s lips, his teeth, his hands.

Cum was still dripping from his pink, swollen entrance. Mo Ran had offered to wipe it away when the sex pollen had finally started to clear up, leaving him abashed at the mess he’d made of his disciple, but Chu Wanning had immediately declined, calling it ‘a gift from his Shizun’.

Now, that sweet disciple of his was curled into Mo Ran’s arms, flushed cheek resting against the older man’s chest as he breathed quietly. One of Mo Ran’s hands was gently rubbing his back, stroking him from the top of his shoulders all the way down to the swell of his ass, though not any further.

Lips curling, Mo Ran listened to the sound of Chu Wanning falling asleep.

“Sweet baobei,” he murmured.

“Mhn?” though half-asleep, Chu Wanning still answered him.

Mo Ran’s smile widened.

“Mm,” he hummed, “I have another question before I’ll let you get some rest.”

Chu Wanning’s eyelashes tickled his skin as the younger man blinked tired, half-lidded eyes open.

“What is it, Shizun?”

Letting a finger tilt Chu Wanning’s chin up, Mo Ran shot him a fond, affectionate smile.

“Instead of Shizun,” he murmured quietly, “what does Wanning think about calling me husband?”
